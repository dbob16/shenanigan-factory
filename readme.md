# Welcome to my config files for VSCodium

I usually use VSCodium as my code editor of choice and I decided to create this repo which has my config files in it. Enjoy.

# To use

Clone into a directory and copy the settings.json and snippets folder into the working files for your VSCodium (may also work with VSCode as well), or create a new profile and put settings.json and snippets into the folder for the newly created profile.
